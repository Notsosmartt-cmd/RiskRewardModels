# RiskRewardModels
 
Simple java code to model some risk management for my trading account.


(If this repo is made public)


These models may not work for normal trading accounts. I trade future contracts on crypto derivative pairs, so I am able to use high leverage with the little money that I have.
I use my home built computer with used parts to mine crypto coins,which gives little profitibility, but with what little capital I use it to test trading strategies.
The capital is too little to invest so trading it with high leverage will, hopefully, give me resonable profit if my strategy and risk management is good.
